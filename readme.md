## Installing

```shell
npm install flatten-overlapping-ranges
```


## Usage

```js
const flatten = require('flatten-overlapping-ranges')

const sections = flatten([
	['A', 0, 7], // start a 0, length of 7
	['B', 2, 12],
	['D', 5, 5],
	['C', 12, 7]
])
console.log(Array.from(sections))
```

```js
[
	[2, ['A']], // length of 2
	[3, ['A', 'B']],
	[2, ['A', 'B', 'D']],
	[3, ['B', 'D']],
	[2, ['B']],
	[2, ['C', 'B']],
	[5, ['c']]
]
```

Instead of strings as range IDs, you can use anything a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) works with:

```js
flatten([
	[{name: 'A'}, 0, 7],
	[{name: 'B'}, 2, 12]
])
```
